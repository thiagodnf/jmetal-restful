**A RESTFul Web Service for JMetal Framework**

Overview

JMetal RESTFul was built to turn available some features available in <a href="https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal">JMetal Framework</a>. This tool uses a RESTFul server powered by <a href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a> to expose some operations that can be access through POST requests.

First, the tool receives as input a JSON-formatted string in the body of a POST request provided by a client. Next, this one converts this string into a object instance that will used to run the algorithms available in JMetal Framework. When it is done, JMetal RESTFul will return a JSON-formatted string to the client. 

Example of JSON requests
---

The following string is an example of JSON-formatted one that you should send to JMetal RESTFul

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "solutions": [
    {"objectives": [20, 12], "variables": ["0101"]}, 
    {"objectives": [2, 11], "variables": ["0101"]}
  ]
}
```
